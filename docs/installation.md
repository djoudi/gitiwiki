# Installation

Gitiwiki is a PHP application, using the framework [Jelix](http://jelix.org), and
the [Glip library](https://github.com/patrikf/glip) to read the content of a git
repository.

WARNING: You will probably think that the installation is a bit complicated for
a non-developer, but don't worry! For the moment, GitiWiki targets only developers
who want to contribute to the project. The first release will contain of course a
wizard which will simplify everything!

Here are steps:

1. checkout the source code with `git clone`
2. put "write" rights for your web server on these directories
  - temp/gitiwiki
  - gitiwiki/var/log/
  - gitiwiki/var/books/
3. configure a virtual host with `gitiwiki/www` as a document root
4. configure your virtual host with an alias `/jelix/` to `lib/jelix-www`
5. in gitiwiki/var/config, copy defaultconfig.ini.php.dist to defaultconfig.ini.php
   and profiles.ini.php.dist to profiles.ini.php
6. open a console and go into gitiwiki/install, and launch `php installer.php`

In next instructions, we assume that the domain name of your virtual host is
localhost.

Gitiwiki is almost ready. It needs now a Git repository.

Let's use the repository used for tests:

1. in the console, go into gitiwiki/var/repositories
2. unzip testrepos.zip. You should have a "default" directory.
3. open gitiwiki/var/config/defaultconfig.ini.php, and go at the end of file
4. in the gwrepo_default section, set the `path` property, by indicating the full
path to gitiwiki/var/repositories/default/

And that's all.

If you type http://localhost/index.php/wiki/default/, you should see a page with
a "hello world" ;-)
